# HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE

We know that looking for a job takes time, and we don't want to take
too much of yours.  We think this problem will take less than an hour
to complete, but you won't be judged by how long you take.  However,
if this problem is asking you to do more than can reasonably be done
in an hour, we'd like to know about it so we can fix it.


# WHAT DOES IT DO

# WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

Extend this program to keep track of who chewed each different kind of
bubble gum.  Add a Chewer model, and an association between BubbleGum
and Chewer:

[UML (after)](http://yuml.me/54785ab0)

The user should be able to add, edit and delete chewers, and select
which chewer is associated with a given bubble gum.
